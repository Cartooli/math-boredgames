## Discussion #1: Complete Problem Generators (35 Topics)

**Category:** Feature Requests (or General if not available yet)  
**Title:** 📚 Complete Problem Generators (35 Topics)

**Body:**
```markdown
## Overview
Currently only 9 of 44 topics have custom problem generators. Users can't practice advanced topics like Trigonometry, Calculus, Matrices, Logarithms, and more.

## Impact
- 🎯 Critical for high school students (Grades 9-12)
- 💪 Affects Practice Mode functionality
- 📊 Blocks learning for 35 important topics

## Needed Generators
The following topics need custom problem generators:
- Trigonometry (sin, cos, tan)
- Calculus (derivatives, integrals)
- Matrices operations
- Logarithms
- Exponential functions
- Law of Sines/Cosines
- Sequences and Series
- Standard Deviation
- Probability
- Combinations & Permutations
- Complex numbers
- Polynomial division
- Rational expressions
- Conic sections
- Parametric equations
- Vectors
- And 19+ more topics

## Current Progress
✅ **9 topics completed** with custom generators  
⏳ **35 topics remaining** with generic fallback problems

## Why This Matters
Students trying to practice advanced math topics (especially Grades 9-12) currently get generic, low-quality problems that don't teach the concept properly. This makes MathBored less useful for high school and AP prep.

## Discussion #2: Comprehensive Lessons (32 Topics)

**Category:** Feature Requests  
**Title:** 📖 Comprehensive Lessons (32 Topics)

**Body:**
```markdown
## Overview
Only 12 topics have fully-written lessons. Remaining 32 topics use generic templates with minimal content.

## Impact
- 📝 Affects Lesson Mode quality
- 🎓 All grade levels affected
- 📚 Students need better explanations

## What's Needed
Each lesson should include:
- ✅ Detailed concept explanations
- ✅ Multiple worked examples (3-5 per concept)
- ✅ Real-world applications
- ✅ Visual examples and diagrams
- ✅ Step-by-step solution breakdowns
- ✅ Common mistakes to avoid
- ✅ Practice tips

## Current State
**12 topics** have comprehensive lessons:
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Fractions, Decimals, Percentages
- Basic Algebra, Equations
- And a few others

**32 topics** have placeholder lessons:
- Just a definition
- Maybe one example
- No visual aids
- No real-world context
- Minimal learning value

## Why This Matters
Students use Lesson Mode to LEARN new concepts, not just practice them. Without quality lessons, students can't understand WHY math works, only HOW to solve specific problems.

## Discussion #3: Interactive Visualizations

**Category:** Feature Requests  
**Title:** 🎨 Interactive Visualizations

**Body:**
```markdown
## Overview
Add interactive diagrams, animations, and visual representations for geometry, graphing, and functions.

## Impact
- 👁️ Visual learners need to SEE concepts
- 📐 Critical for geometry topics
- 📈 Essential for graphing and functions
- 🧠 Improves comprehension and retention

## Proposed Visualizations

### Geometry
- Interactive shapes (click to rotate, resize)
- Angle measurement tools
- Area/perimeter visual calculators
- 3D shape viewers

### Graphing
- Live function plotters
- Drag points to see equation changes
- Slope visualization
- Intercept highlighting

### Algebra
- Equation balancing animations
- Variable substitution visuals
- Factoring step-by-step diagrams

### Fractions
- Visual fraction bars
- Pie chart representations
- Equivalent fractions animation

## Examples of Tools Needed
- Canvas-based drawing tools
- Interactive coordinate planes
- Animated step-through solutions
- Drag-and-drop manipulatives

## Why This Matters
Research shows visual learning improves math comprehension by 30-40%. Many students struggle because they can't "see" abstract concepts. Interactive visuals bridge the gap between theory and understanding.

## Discussion #4: Progressive Hint System

**Category:** Feature Requests  
**Title:** 💡 Progressive Hint System

**Body:**
```markdown
## Overview
Students get stuck with no help between "no info" and "full solution." Add progressive hints that guide without giving away the answer.

## Impact
- 🧠 Reduces frustration
- 💪 Improves learning outcomes
- 🎯 Helps students learn problem-solving strategies

## How It Would Work

### Example: Solving `3x + 7 = 22`

**Hint 1 (Strategic):** "First, isolate the term with the variable"  
**Hint 2 (Specific):** "Subtract 7 from both sides"  
**Hint 3 (Step):** "3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7"  
**Hint 4 (Almost there):** "Now divide both sides by 3"  
**Show Solution:** Complete step-by-step solution

### Benefits
- Students learn incrementally
- Maintains challenge and engagement
- Teaches problem-solving process
- Prevents giving up too early
- No more "binary" help (nothing vs. full solution)

## Current Problem
Right now, if students are stuck, they can only:
1. Keep guessing blindly
2. View the complete solution (spoils learning)

There's no middle ground for scaffolded learning.

## Implementation Ideas
- "Get a Hint" button (progressive hints)
- Hint counter (doesn't affect score)
- Optional: "I'm really stuck" → bigger hint
- Hints tailored to each problem type

## Discussion #5: Difficulty Levels (Easy/Medium/Hard)

**Category:** Feature Requests  
**Title:** 🎚️ Difficulty Levels (Easy/Medium/Hard)

**Body:**
```markdown
## Overview
All practice problems are currently the same difficulty. Add difficulty selector for each topic.

## Impact
- 📊 Enables adaptive learning
- 👶 Makes content accessible to struggling students
- 🚀 Provides challenge for advanced students
- 🎯 Improves confidence and reduces frustration

## How It Would Work

### Example: Multiplication

**Easy:**
- Single digit × single digit
- Example: 3 × 7

**Medium:**
- Double digit × single digit
- Example: 23 × 7

**Hard:**
- Multi-digit multiplication
- Example: 234 × 76

### Benefits
- Students start at their level
- Progress naturally to harder problems
- No more "too easy" or "too hard"
- Builds confidence gradually
- Advanced students stay challenged

## Current Problem
- Struggling 3rd graders get problems that are too hard
- Advanced students get bored with too-easy problems
- No way to customize difficulty
- One-size-fits-all approach doesn't work

## Implementation Ideas
- Difficulty selector before starting practice
- Auto-adjust based on performance (optional)
- Badge system for completing harder levels
- Save preferred difficulty per topic

## Use Cases
- **Remedial Learning:** Start with easy, build confidence
- **Grade-Level Practice:** Use medium difficulty
- **Advanced/Gifted:** Jump straight to hard problems
- **Test Prep:** Practice hard problems for exams

## Impact
- 📈 Critical for Algebra and Pre-Calculus
- 🎓 Grades 8-12 students need visualization
- 📐 Helps understand function behavior
- ✅ Enables self-checking answers

## Features Needed

### Basic Graphing
- Plot linear equations: `y = 2x + 3`
- Plot quadratic functions: `y = x² - 4x + 3`
- Plot points: `(3, 5)`, `(-2, 4)`
- Draw lines between points

### Interactive Features
- Zoom in/out

- Use external tools (breaks flow)
- Can't easily check if their answer is correct

## Use Cases
- **Slope:** Visualize rise over run
- **Intercepts:** See where lines cross axes
- **Functions:** Understand behavior and transformations
- **Systems:** Find intersection points
- **Homework Help:** Check answers instantly

## Tools Like This
Similar to but simpler than:
- Desmos (full-featured)
- GeoGebra (complex)
- We need: Simple, focused, integrated

## Current State
- Practice mode is untimed (good for learning)
- No urgency or challenge
- Can't practice for timed tests

## Why This Matters
Many students need to:
- Prepare for timed standardized tests
- Build mental math speed
- Practice working under pressure
- Challenge themselves competitively

## Implementation Ideas
- Toggle: "Practice" vs "Timed" mode
- No penalty for using timed mode
- Stats track both modes separately
- Optional: Daily challenges

## Use Cases
- **Test Prep:** SAT/ACT math sections
- **Classroom:** Timed quizzes
- **Personal Goals:** Beat your best time
