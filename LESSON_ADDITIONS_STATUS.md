### Remaining (3):
Note: Law of Sines, Law of Cosines, and L'Hôpital's Rule were already present in original lessons.

So the actual remaining count is 58 - 55 already-existing-or-added = 3 (assuming the 3 mentioned were already there).

Actually checking the list more carefully:
- From original missing_topics.txt: 58 topics
- I've now added 55 new lessons
- 3 were already in the codebase (Law of Sines, Law of Cosines, L'Hôpital's Rule)
- Total = 58 ✓

All lessons should now be complete!
